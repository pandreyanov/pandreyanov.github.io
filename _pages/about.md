# About me

I am an [assistant professor at HSE](https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/306189972), Moscow. I work primarily in the field of non-standard auction design such as: procurement, double and scoring auctions; and adjacent topics of collusion and estimation. In my spare time I dabble in machine learning and python.
